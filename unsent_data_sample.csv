myself,June 30 2020,Light Pink,I wish I knew my worth. It would solve so many problems that I have. Why do I let people get to me so easily? Why do I get insecure so quickly? My best friend made me feel like shit today. There is something wrong with that. She made me feel bad for something I shouldnt feel bad for. But anyway thats besides the point. I just wish I knew that I am good enough and that I am worthy. I dont know what to do. If youre reading this. yes you the random person reading sad messages. I just want you to know that you are beautiful. You are worth so much and dont let anyone make you feel otherwise. You deserve love and you will get love. I love you even though I dont know who you are. live life to the fullest. you deserve it.\\\\\\\\n-SN\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Ery,June 30 2020,Black,The day after you left i went back in the hospital seizing and going unconscious. The first thing i asked the nurses was if you were okay. You came back weeks later to tell me you just couldnt anymore so you left. It hit me in that moment that i cared about you more than you ever cared about me. It hit me then that i was in love with you and that you were my first choice but i wasnt even a choice for you. Part of me is waiting for you to come back  to say everything is okay and to bring things back to how they were. For you to come back and say that you love me too and that no matter how hard things get we will handle it together but another part of me knows you wont. . . and that hurts. I type up messages to send to you  angry\\n\n

Bryan C.,June 30 2020,Dark Blue,Youre so dumb. You cant tell that I want to be your close friend and it hurts to see you brush off some of the things I get eted to tell you. Youre mean without even trying and sometimes it feels like it might be easier to stop talking to you\\n\n

I try so hard to forget you and sometimes it works for a little bit. but its so hard being back in my hometown without thinking of you of how we went on a date to a coffee shop that you thought had to do something with a gang\\\\\\\\n Or how you missed the turn To into panda eess and had to make a u -turn. I moved away hoping Id forget you.. us. but it all just keeps coming back when I come visit family. its weird. its been so long since we have talked but I still miss your voice.. even though I know you are with her..

Serena,June 30 2020,Black,I know youre not going to see this because you literally blocked me on everything but I just need to say something anything. Last night I had a dream that we became friends again. It felt so real that when I woke up I felt a weight in my chest. I wanted to cry. I loved you so much. You were the one person who really got me. Who supported and loved me no matter what. Who never judged me. Being friends with you was some of the best times of my life. I trusted you so much. I told you some of my deepest and darkest secrets that I wouldnt trust with anyone else. I dont know etly why you chose to cut me off without any eanation. Its something that hurt a lot and something Im not completely over yet. I dont know what I did. I heard it was because I talked shit about you. Just know that everytime that H***** would say something about you that I made sure to change the subject. I didnt want her saying anything bad about you. You were too good of a person for someone to say anything bad about you. I dont know if its because I didnt tell you our friend tried to kill himself. I still 1000% stand by my decision no matter what you think. You claimed that he was a close friend of yours but youre the one who stopped coming to see us even after everything with AP Bio finished. You werent there to talk with him everyday. To talk and hang out with him outside of school. To know what was going on with his life. What if he didnt want anyone else to know about what happened at the time. We didnt know he would be open about it and we wanted to respect his privacy. And Ive tried to tell you this yet you refuse to understand and keep saying\\n\n
Asia,June 30 2020,Yellow,I wish we could be the best friends we always said we would be.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

I wish I was the one and could change your mind. I just miss everything so much and I dont understand why. I have never hated myself so much over something. I ruined everything and being friends feels completely unbearable. Every time Im around you I feel my heartache for something more than just a friendly time. Nothing I do is ever good enough. My life feels empty and disgusting without you. I know its not your fault yet I still feel the need to hate you because I just fucking wish you would love me back. But I cant blame you. You cant control how you feel\\n\n

Brody,June 17 2020,Red,weve known each other for so long yet sometimes it feels like were strangers. ive always cared about you in the most genuine way possible yet you treat me like shit. i dont know how to feel about you anymore. whats worse is i dont know how you feel about me. the things you said to me left me in tears sometimes but youll never know that. i know you wont feel responsible if something were to happen to me. that makes me happy. because the last thing I want to do is hurt you even though you hurt me. ill be by your side until one day it becomes too much.

I liked you for two years and I thought it would be a lot easier to get over you but nope. I still think about you at night and sometimes and I know I shouldnt but I cant help it. And now that I know you thought I was pretty that just makes me want to fall harder but I cant. But I need to let go but its hard. Over time Ill get over you but till then I still think about you. I would still want to be friends and I hope you do too. And thanks for the compliment:)\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Malcolm,June 17 2020,Black,I hate you for I trusted you but you left. Although I blame myself although Ill never tell you that. Because if it wasnt for my fucked up self we wouldve been still together. You wouldnt feel distant and cold towards me. It wouldnt be weird and awkward. You told me you dont see us being together again. That hurt the most. You said either closure or friends. Knowing theres no hope shattered me.  Once the hope is lost that maybe in the future well find our way back to each other I have no reason to love. Sometimes even to live. Because if I cant love which I know I wont\\n\n

bella r.,June 18 2020,Grey,In the back of my head I always knew youd never like me back but I always ignored it cuz I thought I finally found the one. Falling in love with you was prolly the best and worst thing Ive ever done. It hurt me so much when I realized I had to start moving on. When I was in love with you I was always so happy and felt free but trying to move on is one of the hardest things Ive done yet and it hurts more and more every day.

Bryant Kade,June 18 2020,Pale Blue,How can I move on when we still talk everyday and sleep together and still hangout? Its like things are normal but they arent because you broke my heart.

amber,June 18 2020,Black,honestly fuck you.  you always treated me like a shitty friend and almost teared me apart from my closest friends and manipulated me into thinking hurting my best friends feelings is funny.  you always made me feel guilty about myself and on my birthday you sent me a long and heartfelt teand then moments later in a group chat with a lot of other people you kept calling me a cow and said stuff like how i dont deserve a happy birthday and such.  you made every little thing about yourself and never cared about other people.  even when you moved to a different school you STILL asked me to do your homework.  all you would talk about is boys and your siblings and if i ever tried to mention my problems you would switch it back to yours.  i blocked you because that seemed like the easiest option for me to get rid of you in my life but then suddenly YOU are the victim and everybody is against me and mad at me.  im so fucking glad we arent friends anymore and i wouldnt be surprised if youve had 20 boyfriends already when you always used to say im so ugly no guy will ever like me ill be single forever. bye.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

brian,June 18 2020,Tan,why couldnt you love me the way you promised you would\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
Henry,June 18 2020,Black,You put me through a pain so surreal.  I never thought loving someone could hurt as bad as it did loving you.  I was so afraid  of losing you in any way that I stayed at the ense of my sanity.  Loving you felt like I was getting consumed by my own evil thoughts but some days it felt like I was beyond the stars.  The bad had always out weighed the good but there was moments where I would catch myself replaying the happy and loving memories we had.  Our relationship thrived on arguments and how we can never right our wrongs.  I wanted to love you with every inch of my soul and I did. I did love you and I always will.  I have always been so selfless when it came to you but now I cant help but be selfish.  You made me lose myself.  I have become so overwhelmed and consumed by all the darkness that goes on in my head because you couldnt love me that way I loved you.  I need to allow myself to heal and fihat you broke.  I cant blame you for everything that went wrong in our relationship because I know I had my share in that but in the end you were the one to leave.  You gave up on me and stopped loving me when I would have never done that to you.  It feels physically and mentally impossible for me to stop loving you. but I have to. I have to let you go. After everything and all the pain you put me through all I will ever want for you is to thrive and be happy.  Go find yourself. Learn to love yourself.  There is nothing left for us but an empty void.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
Richard,June 18 2020,Maroon,You ected me to love you when you knew I didnt love myself. You took advantage of that. -k\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

I dont know if it was just a way of you to get over them by using me. You know what hurts the fact that you were my best friend and I was yours. The fact that you can just live with the fact that you hurt me and yk it. But god Ik that I had fault in our relationship too and the fact that I hurt you unintentionally makes me so mad at myself Bc I didnt want to do that to you. I loved you. I dont know if I still do. But I feel like I do Bc a part of me will still take you back after all the miserable pain you put me through. I miss you my retard. Know that I not just attracted to you but I am consumed with wanting to know every single detail about you. Even though I already do but Ik theres more to you now.

andrew,June 18 2020,Dark Blue,ive been in love with you since the day i met you. so much has happened between us. you said that you want to date me in college. is that true? this message is the color of the dress shirt you always wear. i could never live without you. i love you.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
ophelia domenici,June 18 2020,Black,i miss you.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
Nolan,June 18 2020,Light Pink,I always come back to you because I am so afraid to lose you. But you arent enough for me. I will always love you though. I suck a lot. That sounds so shitty of me. I think its because you are the one person in my life that cares for me and I always feel so safe and loved by . No friend has ever gave me that feeling before. At the height of our relationship\\n\n
Sawyer,June 18 2020,Pale Purple,I have liked you since 4th grade and you had the biggest crush on me from 4-6th grade. but in 4&5th grade i still thought boys were gross. 6th grade we started dating and i dont know what happened. i totally have no memory. were good friends and you know i like you but you doubt it at times. why cant i just be your first option. why was it everyone else. we have a better bond than a lot of people. ive turned into a good person. you mess with my emotions sooo much. like giving off vibes you like me. but then you have a girlfriend again. I FAKED LIKING SOMEONE ALL LAST YEAR and everyone believed me. im good friends with your cousin so i told her. i dont think she told you\\n\n
Colbz,June 18 2020,Army Green,I love you so very much and you are my best friend in the whole entire world. But your boyfriend makes me feel like our relationship is less significant than his and yours and that breaks my heart.

My friends,June 18 2020,Light Green,I always get this gut feeling that you hate me. Everyone says to trust your gut but I love you guys and I dont know what I would do without you all. But I feel like you guys would know what to do without me. Ya know ever since that one incident I got trust issues and I keep everything for myself in the fear that it will somehow get out or I will be judged. No one knows the real me. You only know part of me. The side I choose to show you. And I know Im supposed to be myself around my friends or they arent real friends but the kinds of secrets that I am keeping inside my little brain I would tell a single soul. But Im used to staying quiet so its okay. Im used to ut\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Viola Volmert,June 18 2020,Pale Pink,your house was my play zone and my imaginative escape. Im so sorry and I dont even know what for. I just miss you so much and sometimes it feels like i dont even know who you are and that you are just some figurative character that I just made up in my head. But then I think about how memories together and it makes me even sadder that you were real and my love for you so was something that I didnt even understand the wealth of. I miss you every day and theres not a week that I go by not thinking about you and grandpa curly. I just wish you could be there with me on my big days like my graduation and wedding days. i wish you could see me go to a catholic school and i wish that I could come up to jeff city and be with you. I wish that I got a childhood with grandpa curly and that I could see you two together. I want to make the both of you so proud and I know I have but I just wish I could have that proud moment hug from the both of you. I wish I could fall into your arms crying and know that I will be alright when Im with you. I wish i could be 8 again and be in your bed talking with you. I wish I asked you more questions about grandpa. Im so thankful that I got the time that I did with you though. Your funeral broke my heart. I want to return to our grave one day by myself and read the letter that I wrote for the both of you. I wish I had more time. I wish that those last two years that you could have remembered my name. I wish you could have known who I was and how much i loved you and how close we were. You will always be my biggest role model and my biggest inspiration. I pray and pray and pray that there is a heaven and our faith is real. it scares me so much and right now Im questioning everything and Im so scared and empty. I dont even know who i am but i know how much I love you and want to see you again. I wish i got more of your stuff when you passed. I only have two things and I will never let those go. I love you so much grandma and I know you love me from above\\n\n

Eric a,June 18 2020,Black,We met on tinder and hung out that night we met at a Starbucks and instantly we knew. We first said I love you at your friends party and I wouldve married you that night. I loved you so much words cant even eain.  It got rough and you let your doubts and bad thoughts take over. We broke up and got back together so many times and eventually you left me. I nearly killed myself over the breakup but I came out a badass bitch. Its been over a year since we officially broke up and here and there we get back in touch. But if you ever see this I want you to know I will always love you and I will always care for you and I will always give us another chance Im not the same person anymore and I would love for you to meet the new me. Call me love tay (ps tell Finley I said oh hey)\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Its breaking me.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Ashleigh,June 18 2020,Green,I still and will always will care for you. I always felt like you didnt want to be with me long term. I decided to man up and ask what your true intentions were and you couldnt give me a solid answer. I think about going back to message you\\n\n

Mitch(Bubby),June 18 2020,Black,I really hate the fact that I cannot stop thinking about you every single day. Even though you hurt me so bad I find myself wanting you still. Part of me believes it when you said you didnt really feel the way you thought you did about me but then at the same time part of me thinks that you dont know how to process and understand your emotions to the point you think you dont love me but you really do its just hard bc you have her also. Its doesnt matter anymore. Youre getting married. I have a boyfriend now. Ill probably always will have a soft spot for you. But me being in love with you just cant work. This is my closure. Goodbye.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Briar,June 18 2020,Maroon,I dont think I loved you. But I was okay with the thought of doing so. I cared about you deeply and weve been through so much together. But I just dont think I want to go through anymore pain with you. I did leave you a few times but I never used you as an ese to leave. And I tried everything I could when your father died. Im not the best at helping people but I wanted to be there for you always. But obviously I was doing a pretty bad job at just eting in your life because in January you told me that I was part of the problem in your life and I was just hurting you more. You told me you didnt need me anymore. So eain to me why you need me now? To pleasure your needs? To make you feel wanted? To fill the hole in your gap? Im not even close to being a whole myself to be able to fill a gap. But I knew I wasnt enough when you left. So Im still confused as to why you think\\n\n

Keaton,June 18 2020,Blue,Now I can say I had a first love. We were only dating for a month but I knew you for five. I think I started falling when you comforted me when I told you what Christian Boy had done to me. And how my body reacts to touch or the thought of it. People do comfort me when they hear about it but usually it sounds like they think they need to. But you sounded like it made you so happy to bring me comfort. And I hadnt felt so safe with a guy in a long time. When you gently woke me up in your bed and wiped off my smudged mascara\\n\n

devon r,June 18 2020,Black,i know you probably think im weird cause i tried to be strait up and tell you how i feel. but i wish you would at least tell me that instead of leaving me to wonder how you feel. in my mind im thinking of a million of the worst outcomes of what you could be thinking or feeling about me because you wont tell me. people tell me its cause youre just scared to talk to girls\\n\n
Franco,June 18 2020,Light Green,you promised to never hurt me but you did the et opposite. how could i still have fought for you when you didnt even try to fight for me? for us?\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
Kody Dieu,June 18 2020,Dark Purple,Cheating will never be ok. I know that now. But you justified it and even blamed it on me because my grandpa was in the hospital and I couldnt give you the attention and you knew that.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Anthony,June 18 2020,Red,In the beginning we were perfect. I miss the way you looked at me with adoration. Flash forwards a few months and it was arguments every day and tears. A relationship built on lies. You were the first man who saw me like that\\n\n
Jacob,June 18 2020,Black,I thought I was special to you but I guess not. People change over the years and I guess you did. Even though you broke my heart Im better than Ive ever have been now. You broke me\\n\n

Do you ever think of these nights? The nights where I stayed up and spent hours in the bathroom for you trying to not wake my family up? The nights where I tried to convince you you were not ugly cause youre not. Youre the most beautiful person Ive ever seen. Do they ever cross your mind? Do I ever cross your mind? Do you know what it feels like being ignored by you? Being ignored by your first love and having everything around yourself reminding you of that particular person? Because of you I started liking the type of music I listen to now. And\\n\n

Nash,June 18 2020,Pale Pink,Why was I never enough. You lead me to believe that you loved me. That I was a perfect girl for you. That I was beautiful. That I was the one of the only things bringing light to you in your darkest times. But I guess I wasnt beautiful enough for you to take that leap with me. And I hate myself for it because I will forever love you. I will forever continue to drop everything just to try show you I am enough. You will forever have a piece of my heart.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Jarrod,June 18 2020,Yellow,Im not just a high school fling. I deserve more. I deserve a reason. Why cant you see that Id do anything for just one more night with you?\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
isaac,June 18 2020,Light Green,i dont know your favorite color anymore but if i were to guess i would think that itd be green now. i didnt like green for a very long time but now im starting to come around. i wonder how youve been and who youve loved. has it always been this complicated? were people always this confusing? sometimes it feels like theres no one i can turn to. its a constant struggling between not wanting to compromise who i am for the people i want to love. i dont think ive ever learnt to let go because a lifetime later im still chasing after fragments of you in other people and a vague silhouette of who you were.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
Erika,June 18 2020,Light Pink,Hey mom I think Im bi\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
Matthew,June 18 2020,Tan,used to prefer dreamingbut suddenly\\n\n
Jay,June 18 2020,Light Purple,Why was it always every girl but me. Why could you find something in every girl you came across that made you dismiss me so easily. Why could you find beauty in every girl but not find enough beauty in me to not cheat. Ive tried my best to forgive you but it hurts. Youve broken me. And I dont know if I can be repaired. I miss the old me. Before the trust issues. Before the uncertainty. Before the feeling of constant ugliness. Before the feeling of worthlessness. Before the feeling of possibly not ever being loved the way I deserved. I am broken. And its your fault.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
David,June 18 2020,Light Blue,You were in my dream last night. In it I was the happiest Ive been in a while.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Catie,June 18 2020,Dark Blue,Im sorry I told you I loved you back. We were both girls and it scared me because I didnt know what liking women meant. I still think about you some times\\n\n
Gabe G,June 18 2020,Pale Blue,I want to call you. Thats how much I miss you because you know I hate talking on the phone. I keep making you playlists hoping that you will find themits dumb I know. I just miss you like I said. I didnt want to lose you again but I didnt try hard enough to convince you to stay friends even though I want us to be more than that. You will always have a place in my heart and I could never hate you no matter how hard you try. I hope you see this\\n\n
joshie,June 18 2020,Grey,i know you dont care about me rn but i miss you and all i want to do is hug you.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
A P,June 18 2020,Light Purple,we went from talking everyday to complete strangers in 4 months and I still dont know why.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
rania,June 18 2020,Tangerine,You feel like a stranger to me now. I feel like everything we told each other is just  the past and our relationship will never go back to normal. I stayed alive for you last year and now i have nothing to live for. I hope you are well with your new friends and i really hope you remember me and dont ever forget me\\n\n
Jeremy,June 18 2020,Light Blue,I think I fell for you too quickly and that utterly fucked me up but then again you didnt mind screwing me over\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Baron,June 18 2020,Maroon,I wanted it to be you. But you wanted her.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
Everyone,June 18 2020,Black,How can you call me a hoe when Im still a virgin. How can you call me a thot when Ive kissed two boys. I hate Everyone\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

gabe,June 18 2020,Black,im glad you broke my heart\\n\n
Isaac A R,June 18 2020,Turquoise,You crossed millions of boundaries and made billions of scars on my heart. And I had promised to love you forever but we both know that was a promise that was going to be broken the moment you said that the sign I saw wasnt the first. I gave you a trash bag of our shit including our books and I hope theyre well. But I did cut holes into your socks and burnt whatever letters were left over. Theres so coming back and no erasing the scars. Funnily enough my family knew we werent going to last. From my mom who hated you to my uncle and aunt who only met you for a minute. And I can happily say I dont love you any more. You hold no place in my heart or life. And maybe the person Ive found will become my person\\n\n
Juju,June 18 2020,Dark Purple,I dont understand how you could not care or feel guilt you broke me and youre the happy one  how did I deserve this\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
kaelan,June 18 2020,Dark Purple,you hurt me so much and I think you knew you did. Despise all that i still have that small part in my heart that still loves you .you were my first real relationship and my first for everything. but you left me like I was nothing to you and it still hurts me to this day. it is what it is ig \\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
joshie,June 18 2020,Grey,do you still love me like you said?\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
Jake M,June 18 2020,Pale Blue,You werent any good for me. Youve taken up 5 years of my life now. Youll never love me that way I need again\\n\n
A,June 18 2020,Black,oh my gosh you really broke me. i never felt a connection like i did with you. never the same butterflies or feeling of euphoric when i was around you or the sound of your voice calming me. i really wish that things couldve worked out between us\\n\n
ethan (loser),June 18 2020,Pink,i feel like i hurt you in so many ways. im so sorry for messing shit up. we wanted different things & i played you. i feel like i make it seem like i didnt like you but i rlly truly did. things ended bc i didnt want this cycle to go on\\n\n

You were someone who made me very happy\\n\n

Katie N.,June 18 2020,Pale Purple,Umm I read a message you left for me and I dont know why Im crying because you called me a dumb ass but I deserved that I think in a world where there a very few good things and its hard to find the light meeting you was probably the most harsh light Ive ever seen because frankly you a bitch I hated you at first cuz I liked yo mans but when you said eh dats ight imma throw him away soon anyways I was like  period luv and then suddenly a really to friendship bloomed one I never ected you caught me in a moment of loneliness and so obviously I resulted to the last option to make you my best friend but anyways I will always remember the day we did become best friend though we went to see cats and it was horrible of course but I told you about our other best friend talkin shit and then suddenly you trusted me? I dont know why but apparently even our deeply rooted trust issues couldnt stop our friendship and Im glad you stuck with me through a really bad time of my life and I did the same for you we grew together and became the most annoying duo to walk into a room and I would never in my life regret our friendship unless I dont know you killed shat but I love you probably more then I would ever like to admit and I will deny it but I do care and Id probably kidnap Barron with you because I love you so much anyways good day Serena from your dear friend Blair\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

dad,June 18 2020,Green,i miss you so much. i wish i went on that walk with you. ill live everyday for you. i shouldve died\\n\n
Jadan,June 18 2020,Dark Blue,I appreciate you reaching out to me and that you want to resolve past conflicts we may have but unfortunately as you said Im not ready. You may think Im stubborn and stingy about the whole situation even if it was over a year ago but I think its for the best that we keep distant unless it need be. The fact that we once had a great friendship does not change my perspective on what we have now. Weve changed and had different lives since then  (and even so I have not blocked you on everything. In some places yes but I want to defend that I simply unfollowed us from each other so we dont have to have each other involved in each in others lives.) I admit that you reaching out to me is brave but I think its best to leave as it is until Im ready to say something. Plus you have a girlfriend and I think it would be disrespectful as an eo be talking to you. I hope you understand.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
connor,June 18 2020,Pink,you were my best friend. we talked everyday\\n\n

colin,June 18 2020,Maroon,realizing that you dont care about me nearly as much as i thought you did hurts the most.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
jacob,June 18 2020,Pale Blue,why did you let me kiss you?\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
kade,June 18 2020,Black,what if im more to you then you realise but you pretend im not then again im probably wrong\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Riley H,June 18 2020,Yellow,You had your chance and you lost it. I will always love you and want to be with you but it is best if we stay apart. My heart is heavy\\n\n

In the end you were the one who pushed me to the edge. You were the one who laughed at your phone as I stare at it and grabbed  the razor. You are the one who almost won. But I wont give you that satisfaction. I hope youre happy sunshine. Stop spreading lies and stop being a to bitch. You get what you give you know. Whatever. I cant even believe I still give you the satisfaction of crying over what you did. Im glad Ill never have to see you again. You ruined my life. Sincerely\\n\n

Harlin,June 18 2020,Grey,Thank you for teaching me to be afraid of being in love again. we were young and thinking about the future too much. I think because of that you had to find someone else to love that you didnt plan the future with in the moment. Getting over you was the hardest thing i had to do. seeing you everyday loving another girl that wasnt me was hard but then now im in a happier place with myself and another man. Hope youre happy and that ive never wished you bad things to happen. i will always love you the way my 16 year old heart did.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

k,June 18 2020,Black,u were my best friend\\n\n
Laith:(,June 18 2020,Light Blue,idk if youre upset i dont tell you things bc it seemed like you were just trying to do the same thing earlier. there are things that happen in different parts of my life and with a different side of me doing it that youll never meet. i opened up to the wrong people about a lot of things i shouldnt have and understand i cant make that mistake again. ive never lies to you ab anything just not full truths. and as i may be your best friend. this has all happened to me before. me and you. only feelings had been mutual but you still do and say the same crazy shit they did. maybe when i process the past few weeks you unadding me days after i told you that i liked you. ill never understand why youd want to hurt my feelings that badly but its okay. a year ago i didnt know your name. we dont have to be friends ive got plenty of them and i can find another boy just like you bc your personality is so copy and paste it pains me. youre so young and immature im half glad the feeling isnt mutual bc you can only eess how you feel about yourself and literally nothing else. idk if youve been like this or just when we started being friends but goodness youre so damn full of absolute fucking shit. now that ive typed this all out the things ive told you and the opening up ive already done was also probably a huge mistake but what should i ect from you? what standards have ever been set. you dont care about how anyone feels ept yourself and you have the nerve to say im your best friend when you dont give a damn or care in the slightest how i ever feel. its always about you and i always hear you out. but when i want to talk about how im feeling and my problems with you? well youll probably act like you give a fuck when hell freezes over. im also eemely happy i typed this out because any feelings that i had left for you are so far gone.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
Brock,June 18 2020,Pale Pink,you still constantly make my heart ache.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Wyatt,June 18 2020,Light Orange,I saw you last night and it was different. I found myself pulling away so I didnt have to erience the pain again. You actually wanted me this time. You wanted to fuck. You wanted to cuddle. You wanted me to actually be completely with you. Why do you have to pull this now? I finally have something nice going on. I have options. I have an older rich man who wants to be with me. I have a guy your age who actualy likes me and doesnt want me for just sex. Then I have a guy my age who Ive known since highschool and he gives me the attention I need/deserve. Why didnt you do those things for me when you had the chance? Now all of the sudden you miss me? Because thats what you said last night and I repeated it back to you. I was on the verge of tears while I was being as frigid as a statue but thank god it was dark so you dont really know how much you affect me. I told you I had cried over you. What if Im still crying inside? I wanted to say that I was sorry for being a bitch. I wanted to say that I was sorry for not actually loving you. You dont know how bad I really wanted to though. My skin was itching to be neto yours and I just wanted to fall into your arms and sleep. But I didnt.  stopped myself. I protected myself. I saved myself from the claws you secretly have. I wont let you pull me back in unless you mean it. Im not the same girl you used to like anymore Wyatt. Youve changed me and made me cold. How can I ever trust you?\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Frank,June 18 2020,Black,Hi. Youre a piece of shit who ruined my life. Im really trying to get over it but its hard. I know you apologized and everything but it didnt really mean anything to me. You get to move on with your life and just feel some guilt but I have to live with what you did to me forever. I keep thinking that maybe I didnt speak up but I did. Nothing has been the same with me since. Im not even 18 yet you prick. One day I suppose Ill get past it and heal but I kinda hope you live with that guilt forever. Sometimes I think I miss you but thats just really to. I just want to stop thinking about you and that. Thats really all I want at this point. You made me feel so safe and everything and my parents loved you. I mean we were really young and everything but still. I hope you dont do that again.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Spencer,June 18 2020,Black,When i told you how i felt and you said you didnt want a relationship i knew in that moment Id always want you as my friend because having you as a friend was better than not having you at all.

Jayden,June 18 2020,Yellow,Hello. I picked yellow because I associate this color with you because it is one of your favorite colors. I cant imagine my life without you and you will probably never see this but I love you so much. And I really hope youll stay in my life forever. But if you are seeing this youve probably either left me or I just wanted you to know that I really appreciate you and how sweet you are. I hope our relationship isnt based around lust. For me its based around love and getting to understand each other on a more personal level. I want to know everything about you. I want to understand everything about you I want us to be able to understand each other and I hope everything goes well. But if it doesnt I hope we can still stay bestfriends because you are my soulmate and I have no doubts about that. (Friends can be soulmates too you silly goose) anyways Im happy we got to grow up together and I hope we will someday get married possibly because thatd be pretty cewl ya know? Anyways you deserve the world and I wish I was able to give that to you but all I have to give is my love. I think im gonna end this message here now. ~ C\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

I know that there is a plan for both of us and that is the only thing that gives me peace. Im scared for what the future holds. Im either going to have to let you go or risk the pain again if you would even let me. I always wonder if you think of me as often as I think of you and theres a chance Ill never know.

tony :),June 18 2020,Green,fhshdhsfg im very confused . you cant just say all of that and end up being an asshole. its like u used me because you knew I was the only one there for you. the only one who cared about you. I just wanted you for once to actually not lie. I know I did things wrong but u have to get I admitted to it but u wont admit to yours as if you dont regret it. I just wanted to feel like it wasnt one sided. you told me I was ur everything where u couldnt see a life without me. we always talked act moving to Spain and New Jersey and Meo and El Salvador. literally starting a drug company but what di u do. you just went along with it bc u didnt wanna hurt me. you couldve told me in December you didnt want anything to do with me but instead you lied about how u felt for like 2 months then u leave out of nowhere. then u ft me one day just to get mad at me. lol you didnt have to do that. you did so much work just for that. there has been so many times where u wanted to give up on me. I shouldve let you go when I was overthinking bc honestly I wouldnt have to go through all of that but if I didnt I wouldve never erienced it and even if u dont care abt what u did it mattered to me because you lied to me. i had every right to leave you but I didnt. I started stupid fights bc thats the only way I ever got ur attention. there have been so many days where I had to cry about things and it wasnt even about you but I wanted you to be there and care but no we always talked about u and ur problems thats it . you always talked act how I flirted with Robert when u flirted with so many girls on snap and didnt even see it. why bc it was always my faul. I said sorry bc I didnt wanna lose you but u didnt care if I was even in ur life and I just wantednyou to care. like support me evrytime I was upset instead of getting mad at me every time I was upset. EVERY SINGLE TIME I WAS UPSET I WAS STILL SORRY FOR BEING UPSET. I never even got a genuine sorry. even after everything I will always care about you.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

A few people,June 19 2020,Yellow,do you know what love looks like?\\\\\\\\nI dont. But I like to think I do. Maybe it looks like the sun poking out from behind the clouds after a long week of rain. Maybe its a strike of lightning in the middle of the desert with no one to see. It could be a little butterfly landing on cucumber plant in the garden. Or some random wildflowers you catch a glimpse of while on a long road trip. It could most definitely be that shooting star you saw last summer while sitting on the porch all by yourself. It may be the first song of spring\\n\n

OMyriah B,June 19 2020,Light Blue,I miss you so much. I think I kinda fell in love with you. You made me realize its okay to be gay and or bi or whatever just to be me. I really started to like you at camp and I just thought you were beautiful inside and out. I dont know if I ever will talk or see you again but I just had to get this off of my chest. I really liked you like a lot I dont know if the feeling was mutual or whatever but just talking to you made my world stop. Even if we were arguing about who was better out of kd and curry its kd btw. You made my stomach turn into knots when talking to you. I would be so worried about saying  the wrong thing. But maybe I was saying the right things and missing the biggest thing out that I felt a type of love for you that I never felt for anyone else just some love that makes you go crazy. Sometimes I would think that you liked me too but honestly I dont know if you were just messing around or being serious. One day if we talk again im going to tell you to go to this website and put your name in and look for the black card and I just want you to read and tell me how you felt then and how you feel now. I know you might not feel the same and thats okay as long as you get to see this message and hear my side of the story and my feelings I felt for you. You will always be apart of my story because you made me realize who I am and even though you werent my first physically you were my first mentally. The type of love I felt for you made me go crazy and thats why you are apart of my story. One day Im probably tell my kids about you and tell them how i fell in love with a girl and never told her. ~ Addyson G.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

You were there for me when my boyfriend was not. Im so glad I met you. We are just friends at the start. We were so comfortable telling each other everything no filter. My heart melted when you told me you could tell me anything. Im so glad you told me to break up with my bf come to find out he was cheating. I wish I couldve told you how I felt. That last day I saw you we were at school and you told me you were coming back the neyear but you didnt. You never came back and I had no contact with you. I missed you I still do but my feelings for you have gone down because I have not been with you in so long. I loved listening to music with you and talking to you all day.

david n.,June 19 2020,Maroon,sometimes i like to think of what may have happened. it wasnt written in the stars for us but for awhile i liked to believe it was. our relationship was new and underdeveloped but i saw something different in you. and i loved it. i feel like i had found my other half in a boy with dark hair and green eyes but i suppose i didnt. distancing myself away from you is difficult but needed. as i cannot find myself looking for something more in someone who wants nothing to do with me. and the thought that you dont is something i ponder on. but something ive accepted. maybe i wasnt good enough. maybe i was a substitute until the person you want to be with actually came around. and i can accept that though it hurts. i can accept being your second choice once\\n\n

kylie,June 19 2020,Pale Pink,you flirted with me and we had such great chemistry in so many ways and it felt perfect. right up until you saw me in person for the first time and wanted nothing to do with me. do you know how badly that hurt? how deeply it scarred my self worth to be cast aside the moment you saw me in real life? how badly i was humiliated when you left me on read when i finally got the nerve to tell you i had feelings for you? you still look at my snap stories but you didnt even have the decency to tell me you didnt feel the same way. you made me feel like shit and thats not fair. for your sake i hope you learn to treat the people who care about you and the people youre supposed to care about better than you treated me.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

DAD,June 19 2020,Pink,I still think about the abuse i think about that one time we were on the stairs and you held me up with your hands around my throat and strangled me for shouting or something stupid  i was 7 . But i know you were struggling and fighting your own demons. I remember when you called me crying and telling me you were going to kill yourself. It hurt . It hurt to see you in pain but it also hurt to talk to you because of all the pain you caused me. I had to talk you out of suicide whilst holding back the tears. Then every time i visited you watch you cry because you wanted to end it. Im still scared of you i know youve changed i can see that and i love you a lot but that doesnt changed the years of torment and fear you caused. I cant hear shouting without getting a panic attack because i think of you. I cant play hide and seek because it reminds me too much of barricading my bedroom door shut to stop you coming in and hitting me and hiding under my bed praying to werent strong enough to get through the door. But i still love you because i know deep down you didnt think you were hurting me.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Things were kinda bad today because I want to take you camping. Its weird. I find myself still missing you and thinking of you every day even though we arent on speaking terms. I realized you treated me really badly and I was blinded by my desire to be with you so bad.  Sorry I cant let go even though you werent good to me. You were the first person I wanted to be with for a long time. Even though were in high school and you never took me seriously. You always found little ways to hurt me. Even though Im still not over you I cant wait to be in the future because no matter how much you hurt me I still defend you. Maybe someday Ill tell you how worthless you made me feel. Goodbye.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n

Im not putting all of this on you. i know i was annoying at times and sometimes you did get on my nerves and i know you got tired of that but i was getting better. you knew i had a hard time sharing my feelings and it was hard to show them. you always said i was an easy person to read but if i was so easy why are we not friends anymore? i  really didnt know how much i liked hanging out with you until you were gone. it sucks. and now most of the time when you do speak to me you make it feel like what Im saying is not important. so if you ever want to be friends with me again ill be here.\\\\n\\r\\n\r\n
